### Postworld Update Server

Based on [WP Update Server](https://github.com/YahnisElsts/wp-update-server) by Yahnis Elsts.

The Postworld Update Server allows developers using Postworld to easily manage the versions of their themes from directly within the WordPress Admin Panel. When they upload a new version of any theme, all websites using that theme will receive a notification to update the theme, and updating the theme for users is only a matter of two clicks.

This allows the theme developer to elegantly take control of the theme rollout process, and keep all users up to date with the latest version of the theme.

#### Features
- Support for multiple themes
- Add unlimited versions of themes
- Allows for simple, organized changelog documentation
